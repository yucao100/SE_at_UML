Currently we have a demo from C++ which performs the following:

- A get request to a website and captures the output into a string which can
  be parsed.
- A post request to a website and captures the output
- A combined request of GET and POST which returns a captured output


The website being tested with returns a result in JSON format which shows that
the data was properly received on the serverside.
